# Spotify-Data-Analysis-predictions

I used datasets that are availible on Kaggle. I love listening to music and love Spotify, so the project choice was perfect for me. My main focus making this project was to explore the data: see some intresting trends among features, plot some 'Most popular' charts. After data analysis I decided to use Popularity feature as Target to predict some future trends. The challendge was to predict popularity using solely properties of the tracks given by Spotify (i.e loudness, sheechiness, instrumentalness etc.)
